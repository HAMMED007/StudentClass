# StudentClass


1. Create a class Student

Student has a name, personal id, admission year, origin country, current address, account number, phone number, curriculum name.

Create 6 student objects in main method.

Make sure, that you have students from Estonia and from your country.

Create an array of students.

2. Create methods in a main class and call them in main method to cover the following:

Print all students' data in a format NAME ADMISSION_YEAR COUNTRY

Calculate, how many students are from your country.

Calculate, how many students are NOT from Estonia.

Find the student(s), who has the earliest admission year.

Find the student(s), who has the latest admission year.

Print all collected data into the file.

3. To participate in a hackathon the students are divided into 2 groups.

Create 2 arrays group01 and group02.
All students with an even admission year value - must be saved into the group01, all the students with an odd value of admission year - must be saved in a group02.
There should be at least 3 participants in one group. If you don't have enough students in any of the group, invite more participants. That means that you need to create additional Student objects and add them to this array.

Print all students' data in a format
Group 01
NAME ADMISSION_YEAR COUNTRY
Group 02
NAME ADMISSION_YEAR COUNTRY
Print all collected data into the file.
